# What the data measures
The data shows the occupation level of 25 to 29 year olds in the UK between 2014 and 2021.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">It also measures the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds in higher professional and lower working class occupations by region.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Regions are ranked in order and then divided into 5 groups, with each group having an equal number of regions.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Regions are based on where the young people who were surveyed lived when they were growing up.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Rates are rounded to 1 decimal place.
