## Summary
The final index for the drivers, R & D environment, comprises 3 new indicators for this year: broadband speed, business expenditure on R & D, and university research students. This index is less securely grounded in prior research than the 2 previous indices. However, we are interested in developing ways of measuring the link between economic opportunity, innovation and business vibrancy on social mobility. We hope to do more work on this in the future. At this point, we note that it is possible that areas with a more favourable R & D environment will be among the more dynamic areas of the country in future decades, and so will provide favourable conditions for upward mobility. We plan to monitor whether this does in fact happen.
