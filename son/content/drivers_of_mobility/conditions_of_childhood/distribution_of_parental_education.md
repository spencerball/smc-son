# What the data measures
The data shows the education levels of adults in families with dependent children. Dependent children are classed as all 0 to 15 year olds, and 16 to 18 year olds who are in full-time education.<br>
<br>
The education levels are:

<ul class="govuk-list" style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
  <li>lower level (below CSE grade 1)</li>
  <li>O level, GCSE and equivalent</li>
  <li>A level and equivalent</li>
  <li>further education (below degree level)</li>
  <li>higher education (above degree level)</li>
</ul>

# Things you need to know
The average age of survey respondents was 40 years old. The majority of respondents are likely to be the parents or carers of dependent children, but some could be adults living at home with parents who have dependent children.
