## Title
Precarious situations

## Summary
This index brings together three measures capturing young people in difficult economic circumstances: economic inactivity, unemployment, and lower working-class employment. The index adjusts for socio-economic background and thus measures how precarious are the situations of young people from similar social backgrounds.

## Section
Summary main findings

## Text
Densely-populated urban areas tend to have a higher proportion of young people in precarious situations compared to more rural areas.

## Text
In particular, ‘productive’ parts of London have high rates of young people in difficult economic circumstances.

## Text
This contrasts with the high proportions in the same areas with <a href="/intermediate_outcomes/composite_indices/promising_prospects" class="govuk-link">promising prospects</a>.

## Text
There are also areas where young people do worse for both promising prospects and precarious situations – for example, Eastern Scotland.

## Section
About the data

## Text
This page combines data from the following 3 indicators into a single ‘composite’ score to give a more reliable picture of geographical mobility patterns:

<ul class="govuk-list list-disc">
    <li><a href="/intermediate_outcomes/work_in_early_adulthood_(25_to_29_years)/economic_activity" class="govuk-link">Economic inactivity</a></li>
    <li><a href="/intermediate_outcomes/work_in_early_adulthood_(25_to_29_years)/unemployment" class="govuk-link">Unemployment</a></li>
    <li><a href="/intermediate_outcomes/work_in_early_adulthood_(25_to_29_years)/occupational_level" class="govuk-link">Occupational level</a> – data on young people in lower working class occupations</li>
</ul>

## Text
Indicators are rescaled to make sure they use a common metric. The best performing area’s score is set to 1 and the least well-performing area’s score is set to 0.

See the [technical annex] for more information on how each area was scored.
