## Title
Promising prospects

## Summary
This index brings together three measures capturing promising prospects for young people, as measured by young peoples’ levels of education, their occupational positions and their earnings. The index adjusts for socio-economic background and thus measures how well young people from similar backgrounds have been faring in education and the labour market.

Summary main findings

## Text
London and some adjoining areas stand out as offering promising prospects to young people.

## Text
At the other extreme, young people brought up in more rural or more remote areas, together with those from some former industrial areas, tend to do less well.

Prospects for young people are likely to vary within these broad areas – particularly in areas such as North Yorkshire, which contains both remote rural areas and thriving urban centres.

About the data

## Text
This page combines data from the following 3 indicators into a single ‘composite’ score to give a more reliable picture of geographical mobility patterns:

<ul class="govuk-list list-disc">
    <li><a href="/intermediate_outcomes/routes_into_work_(16_to_29_years)/highest_qualification" class="govuk-link">Highest qualification</a> – data on young people with university degrees</li>
    <li><a href="/intermediate_outcomes/composite_indices/promising_prospects" class="govuk-link">Occupation level</a> – data on young people in professional occupations</li>
    <li><a href="/intermediate_outcomes/work_in_early_adulthood_(25_to_29_years)/earnings" class="govuk-link">Hourly earnings</a></li>
</ul>

## Text
Indicators are rescaled to make sure they use a common metric. The best performing area’s score is set to 1 and the least well-performing area’s score is set to 0.
