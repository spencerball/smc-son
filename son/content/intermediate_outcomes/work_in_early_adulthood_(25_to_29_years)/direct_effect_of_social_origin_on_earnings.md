Summary main findings

## Text
Data for the period from 2019 to 2021 shows that young people aged 25 to 29 years from professional backgrounds earned significantly more than those from other backgrounds but with the same level of education. For example, young people from higher professional backgrounds earned 18% more than those from a lower working class background with the same qualification level.
<br>
Young women’s hourly earnings were significantly lower than those of young men with the same level of qualification and from the same socio-economic background (SEB).
<br>
Young people from most ethnic minority groups earned around the same as White British young people from the same socio-economic background. Earnings were lower for young people from the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups.
<br>
Disabled young people earned significantly less than those without a disability from the same socio-economic background.

# What the data measures
The data shows the effect of young people’s socio-economic background on their earnings. ‘Young people’ in the data are 25 to 29 years old.

# Things you need to know
Data is weighted using LFS population weights. Earnings are adjusted for inflation.
<br>
Data is combined for 3 years (for example, 2019 to 2021) to give more accurate estimates.
<br>
Percentage differences were estimated from a linear regression model of log hourly earnings, controlling for educational level, socio-economic background and age. 
<br>
For data by sex, ethnicity and disability status, estimates are shown for people aged 27 years with the lowest levels of education. For data by ethnicity, a simplified measure of socio-economic background is used (professional and non-professional) so that sample sizes are large enough to analyse.
