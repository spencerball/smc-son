## Summary
Data on the effect of different levels of education on the earnings of young people aged 25 to 29 years.

## Subtitle
Summary main findings

## Text
Data for the period from 2019 to 2021 shows that higher levels of education among 25 to 29 year olds led to higher earnings. Young people with a higher degree – such as a master’s degree – earned 63% more than those from the same socio-economic background (SEB) with no GCSEs. Young people with an undergraduate degree earned 54% more.
<br>
The ‘earnings gaps’ between young people with different levels of education remained similar in the 6 years before the 2019 to 2021 period. 
<br>
Young women’s hourly earnings were significantly lower than those of young men with the same level of qualification and from the same socio-economic background.
<br>
Young people from ethnic minorities earned around the same as White British young people with the same level of qualification.
<br>
Disabled young people earned significantly less than those without a disability with the same level of qualification. For people with an undergraduate degree (but not a higher degree), disabled young people earned 84% of the hourly earnings of those without a disability.

# What the data measures
The data shows the effect of different levels of education on the earnings of young people aged 25 to 29 years in the UK.

# Things you need to know
Data is weighted using LFS population weights. Earnings are adjusted for inflation.
<br>
Data is combined for 3 years (for example, 2019 to 2021) to give more accurate estimates.
<br>
Percentage differences were estimated from a linear regression model of log hourly earnings, controlling for educational level, SEB, gender and age. 
<br>
For data by year, the estimates refer to the hourly earnings of men from a lower working-class background. 
<br>
For data by sex, ethnicity and disability status, estimates are shown for people aged 27 years from lower working-class backgrounds. 
<br>
For data by ethnicity, a simplified measure of educational level is used, (degree-level and non-degree level qualifications) so that sample sizes are large enough to analyse.
