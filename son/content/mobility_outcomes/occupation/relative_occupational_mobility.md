# What the data measures
The data shows changes in relative occupational mobility – the extent to which your occupational class is related to your parents’ occupational class.
<br>
High levels of relative occupational mobility can be due to both downward and upward mobility.

# Things you need to know
Survey respondents were 25 to 64 years old. Areas represent where respondents lived when they were aged 14 years.
<br>
The data uses the ‘UNIDIFF’ (uniform difference) model, which compares ‘odds ratios’ for all groups with a benchmark group. Values are shown in log form.
<br>
Values close to 0 mean relative mobility is constant across all groups. Negative values mean relative mobility is higher than in the benchmark group. The differences were statistically significant from 2019 onwards.
<br>
For data by disability status, respondents were asked if they had a health condition or illness lasting 12 months or more, and if that condition reduced their ability to carry out day-to-day activities. This is consistent with the definition of disability in the Equality Act 2010.
