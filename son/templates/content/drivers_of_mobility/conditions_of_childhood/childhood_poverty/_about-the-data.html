        What the data measures
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        The data shows the percentage of children living in households in relative poverty after housing costs in the UK.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Data is calculated using 3-year averages. For example, the figure for 2019 represents the average of the financial years starting in 2017, 2018 and 2019.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Financial years are reported by the year in which they start. For example, 2019 represents the financial year ending in 2020.
