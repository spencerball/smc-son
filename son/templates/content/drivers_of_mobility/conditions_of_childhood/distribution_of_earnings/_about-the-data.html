        What the data measures
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-1">
        The data measures the gap in hourly earnings between people at the:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>90th percentile (‘high earners’) – they earn more than 90% of people</li>
        <li>10th percentile (‘low earners’) – they earn less than 90% of people</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        The ‘90:10 ratio’ is calculated as income at the 90th percentile divided by income at the 10th percentile.
        For example, a ratio of 2 means that people at the 90th percentile earn twice as much as people at the 10th percentile.

        Things you need to know
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        This data uses the ‘90:10 ratio’ rather than the Gini coefficient (a commonly-used measure of income inequality).
        This is for ease of understanding. It uses data from ASHE instead of other sources because ASHE includes data on regional differences.
