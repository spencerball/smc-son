                Inequality in hourly pay between high and low earners got narrower between 2011 and 2021.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                From 1997 to 2011, ‘high earners’ (people in the 90th percentile for hourly pay) earned around 4 times
                as much as ‘low earners’ (people in the 10th percentile).
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Inequality in hourly pay then went down every year over the next 10 years. In 2021, higher earners
                earned around 3.2 times as much as low earners.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Inequality in hourly pay was higher in England than Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
                In England, wage inequality was highest in London.
