    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        It also measures the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds in higher professional and lower working class occupations by region.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Regions are ranked in order and then divided into 5 groups, with each group having an equal number of regions.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Regions are based on where the young people who were surveyed lived when they were growing up.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Rates are rounded to 1 decimal place.
