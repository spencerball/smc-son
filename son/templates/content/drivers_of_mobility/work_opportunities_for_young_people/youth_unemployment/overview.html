                The youth unemployment rate was 17% in 2014, the highest rate at any time between 2014 and 2021.

                In the 3 years from 2018 to 2021, unemployment rates for 16 to 24 year olds were higher in metropolitan
                areas, such as London, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Rates were lower in more rural areas, such as the Highlands and Islands, Northern Ireland and North Yorkshire.
